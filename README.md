# Herokuapp

A simple django playground which aims to understand and implement REST Apis using Django Rest Framework.

What I learnt?

    - DRF Authentication and Permissions
    - DRF Serializers
    - DRF Views and Viewsets

Steps:

1. Create a virtual environment
2. Clone application from git.
3. Install django and DRF
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Migrate the application
    python manage.py migrate
5. Create superuser
    python manage.py createsuperuser
6. Run server
    python manage.py runserver 0:8080
7. Insert few sites and site holding data to database to play around apis
8. Download the postman json file and import in postman to find all api usage.
